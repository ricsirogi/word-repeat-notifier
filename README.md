# word-repeat-notifier
This program tries to write out every repeated word, and it's occurences, also a word and a sentence counter too

It's like... really bad.

BUT

I did it in a coding competition with [skalixur](https://github.com/skalixur) AND I WON!!!!!!

Dependencies:
- Python 3.9 or above (maybe works with less too, but I wrote this in 3.9)
- tkinter 8.6 or above (maybe works with less too, but I wrote this in 8.6)
